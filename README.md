# DeepGraph
DeepGraph supports a 360Â° view on graph technology and supports analytics, storage and visualization.

## Analytics

**DeepGraph** supports a GraphFrame-based interface to the following algorithms:

### Adamic Adar

Adamic Adar is a measure used to compute the closeness of nodes based on their
shared neighbors. This measure is defined as the inverted sum of degrees of the 
common neighbours for given two vertices.
